We should only be auto-generating ORM and view files.

The contents of app.js should be static by....

calling one META_ORM object, with all of the sub objects underneath...
This META_ORM Object should be autogenerated too and live in the orm directory...

using an exports module archtecture...

Then we should move to using a variable for the second entity of the REST call.. so instead of seperate routes for

'/API/Providers/'
'/API/Addresss/'
'/API/OtherThings/'
.... etc

We should have one REST router that does

'/API/:ObjectName/:id'
'/API/:ObjectName/'

And then see if ObjectNAme exists and then go from there....
